# System configuration

The **System** page contains everything that administrators need to closely monitor the various processes running behind the scenes of Customer Insights. It includes four tabs: **Status**, **Schedule**, **About**, and **General**.

> [!NOTE]
> If your data sources are updated on a regular basis, we highly recommend that you use the **Schedule** tab. Make sure to review the "Schedule tab" section later in this topic.

## Status tab

The **Status tab** lets you track the progress of data ingestion and several important product processes. Review the information on this tab to ensure the completeness of any major process you've defined in Customer Insights. This tab includes a table with separate sections for each type of refresh task that has been and could be run in your environments, including tables for data sources, system processes, and data preparation. The refresh tasks align with the entities in your system.

The **Status table** has three columns. The left column specifies the name of task and its corresponding entity. The middle column defines the status of the current or last run of that task, and the right column specifies when the task was last updated. You can view the details of the last several runs of the task by selecting its name. For example, you can get an idea about the typical processing time for a given task.

### Status types

There are six types of status for tasks in Customer Insights. The following status types also show on the *Match*, *Merge*, *Data Sources*, *Segments*, *Measures*, *Enrichment*, *Activities*, and *Predictions* pages:

- **Processing:** Task is in progress. The status can change to Successful or Failure.
- **Successful:** Task completed successfully.
- **Skipped:** Task got skipped because it depends on downstream processes that failed or got skipped. For more information, see [Refresh policies](#refresh-policies).
- **Failure:** Processing  of the task has failed.
- **Canceled:** Processing was canceled by the user before it finished.
- **Queued:** Processing is queued and will start once all the downstream tasks are completed. For more information, see [Refresh policies](#refresh-policies).

### Refresh policies

This list shows the refresh policies for each of the main processes in Customer Insights:

- **Data sources:** Runs according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Doesnâ€™t depend on any other process. Match depends on the successful completion of this process.
- **Match:** Runs according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on the processing of the data sources used in the match definition. Merge depends on the successful completion of this process.
- **Merge**: Runs according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on the completion of the match process. Segments, measures, enrichment, search, activities, predictions, and data preparation depend on the successful completion of this process.
- **Segments**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge. Insights depend on its processing.
- **Measures**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge.
- **Activities**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge.
- **Enrichment**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge.
- **Search**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge.
- **Data preparation**: Runs according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Merge.
- **Insights**: Runs manually (single time refresh) and according to the [configured schedule](#schedule-tab). Depends on Segments.

Select the status of a task to see the progress details of the entire job it was in. The refresh policies above can help to understand what you can do to address a **Skipped** or **Queued** task.

## Schedule tab

Use the **Schedule** tab to schedule automatic refreshes of all your ingested Customer Insights data. This helps ensure that updates from your data sources are reflected in your unified customer profile.

1. In Customer Insights, go to **Admin** > **System** and select the **Schedule** tab.

2. The default state for the scheduled refresh is **Off**. To enable scheduled refreshes, change the toggle at the top of the screen to **On**.

3. Choose between **Weekly** (default) and **Daily** refreshes. If you intend to schedule weekly refreshes, select one or more days on which you want to run the refresh.

4. Select the **Time** field. In the timer dropdown, use the arrows to set your refresh timing. When you're finished, select **Set**. If you'd like to schedule multiple refreshes in a single day, select **Add another time**.

5. Select **Save** to apply your changes.

## About tab

The **About** tab contains your organization's **Display name**, the active **Instance name**, and the **Region**. If you have more than one work instance, you should give each an easily identifiable name.

## General tab

There are two options on the **General** tab, **Language** and **Country/Region format**.

Customer Insights [supports a number of languages](supported-languages.md). To change your preferred language, choose a **Language** from the dropdown.

To change your preferred formatting for dates, time, and numbers, use the **Country/Region format** dropdown. A formatting preview is displayed under this field. Customer Insights will automatically suggest a selection when you choose a new language.

Select **Save** to confirm your selections.
