Trigger specific events to occur automatically when your data changes and manage more complex flows directly in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. On the **System** page, select the **Status** tab.

1. In the **Data Sources** section, select **Flows** and select **Create a flow** from the dropdown list.
