# Insights feed and details view

[!INCLUDE [market-insights-eos](../includes/market-insights-eos.md)]

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

The Insights feed is the place to see your insights for your universe. The feed summarizes each insight and you can expand them to see more details.

## Navigate the Insights feed

> ![Insights feed showing cards with news and more](media/feed-view.png)

To see the latest and most relevant insights for your universe go to to the Insights feed.

Select **Insights** in the left navigation or select the product name or icon in the top navigation.

## Work with the Insights feed

In the Insights feed, you can scroll through the list to discover insights for your universe. Separate cards represent individual insights. Every card contains action buttons:

- **Show more** opens the [details view](#discover-more-information-in-the-details-view) of that insight.
- **More information (...)** provides a link to the documentation [explaining the data behind your insights](about-data.md).

At the end of the list of insights for the current time frame, you can select **Load earlier insights** to see additional insights.

## Discover more information in the details view

Each insight offers additional information by adding more context in the details view. Depending on insight type this can be charts, related news, or further information.
For more information, see [Available insights in Market Insights](available-insights.md).

To get back to the feed from a detail view, select the arrow symbol in the header of the detail view.
