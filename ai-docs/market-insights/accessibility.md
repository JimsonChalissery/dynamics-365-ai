# Accessibility for [!INCLUDE[Dynamics 365 Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-long.md)] Preview

[!INCLUDE [market-insights-eos](../includes/market-insights-eos.md)]

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

[Microsoft is committed to building software that enables people with different abilities](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526256) to be productive.   
[!INCLUDE[Dynamics 365 Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-long.md)] Preview enables all users to be productive by providing accessible software that can be used effortlessly, regardless of abilities. 

## Accessibility capabilities built into [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)]

- [Learn more about working with JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JawsDocumentation)
- [Learn more about working with NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/get-help/)

### Use the keyboard to navigate the user interface

Full keyboard accessibility for all user interface elements to empower agents with different motor skills, and to help agents save critical seconds by removing the dependency on a mouse. 
[!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] supports basic keyboard navigation patterns, like switching between elements and selecting them. There are no keyboard shortcuts specific to [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)].

All tables in [!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] follow the same keyboard access pattern:

- A table has only one tab stop.
- Each table row can have several cells. To move within a row, use the left and right arrow keys.
- To move to the next row, use the up and down arrow keys. Focus will move the same cell type in the next row.
- If a cell contains a single control, the focus will move to the control. Simply activate the control to interact with it. Example: "Remove" control to remove the item of that row.

### Heighten color contrast of some text and images

The high contrast setting in Windows heightens the color contrast of some text and images on your computer screen, making those items more distinct and easier to identify. You'll find this setting on the Ease of Access page in [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows10/default.aspx), [Windows 8](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows8/default.aspx), and [Windows 7](https://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/windows7/default.aspx).

### Enlarge the user interface with zooming in the browser

[!INCLUDE[Market Insights](../includes/pn-market-insights-short.md)] supports zooming on the user interface to 200 percent of the original screen size and works with the high contrast settings in either your browser or operating system.

> [!NOTE]
> When zooming the user interface to 200 percent, some fields or controls are hidden to keep it readable. We aim only to hide information and controls that aren't required to complete a task. You can change the zoom level to access these controls.
