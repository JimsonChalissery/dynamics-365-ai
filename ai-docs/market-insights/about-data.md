# Data sources used in Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview

[!INCLUDE [market-insights-eos](../includes/market-insights-eos.md)]

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

Market Insights looks at billions of data points from browser usage and search data to understand what consumers say, seek, and feel in an online world. Read on below to find out more about the different types of data.

## Search data

Market Insights uses data points from billions of searches which web users perform across multiple devices. All data points are **aggregated**, **anonymized**, **normalized**, and converted into signals and insights so no deduction to actual users is possible.

## Browse data

Market Insights uses **opt-in** browser data from users of Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Additionally, browse data is **aggregated** and **anonymized** to ensure the privacy of the users who opted in to share their browser data.

## News data

Market Insights uses a broad variety of international news sites based on Bing News that users visit frequently. Additionally, it analyzes incoming and outgoing traffic to these news sites.

## Web data

Market Insights parses data available on the public web, such as forums, blogs, and review pages.
