# FAQ for Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview

[!INCLUDE [market-insights-eos](../includes/market-insights-eos.md)]

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

Are you new to Market Insights or looking for some help? We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.  

## Where does the data come from?

Market Insights uses billions of data points, mainly from searches which web users performed and browser data. For more information, see [Data sources used in Dynamics 365 Market Insights](about-data.md).

## What does "normalized search volume" mean?

We provide search volume on a scale from 0 to 100 where 100 represents the peak search volume for an element in the given time period. All other data points are relative to this peak search volume. A value of 50 means the element is half as popular from its peak popularity. A value of 0 means that there isn't enough search volume data to provide a normalized value.

## What is a spike increase vs. a gradual increase?

A spike represents a significant increase in search volume over a 24-48 hour period. A gradual increase represents a significant increase in search volume over a 28 or 90 day period. Market Insights uses rolling averages to ensure the increases truly represent a rising interest.

## How often do insights get updated?

It depends on the type of insights. Some are updated daily, others less frequently. Please refer to the documentation about the [available insights](available-insights.md) to learn more.

## What is a "verified" company or product?

We maintain a curated set of entities based on the most popular search queries. These entities are well understood by the system and come with enriched information. **Verified** indicates that the selected element is one of our curated entities. Market Insights can provide better and richer insights for verified entities.
