# Navigate in the app

[!INCLUDE [market-insights-eos](../includes/market-insights-eos.md)]

(This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.)

The main navigation in Dynamics 365 Market Insights Preview lets you access all relevant areas and consists of the header and the left-side navigation. 

## Navigation items

The following items are available:

- The app name redirects you to the Insights feed.

- The help icon opens a pane with helpful links:

    - **Help documentation** brings you to the content you are currently reading.
    - **Community** links a forum where you can post questions, get help from other users or discuss topics related to Market Insights.
    - **Send feedback** opens a feedback form to share your opinion about Market Insights Preview. We'd love to hear from you!
    - **Product tour** walks you through on the most important features in Market Insights Preview.

- The profile picture or initials opens the **My account** pane where you can sign out from the app. If you signed up with your LinkedIn or Google account, we can't show your account picture and show your initials instead.

- The menu icon expands or collapses the side navigation.

    - **Insights** shows the [feed with insights](insights-feed.md) for the elements you defined in your universe.
    - **Universe** allows you to [configure the elements in your universe](universe.md) to receive insights for.
    - **Preferences** lets you [manage your account and the notifications](settings.md).
