# Configure predictive lead scoring

Predictive lead scoring uses a predictive machine learning model to calculate a score for all open leads. The score helps salespeople prioritize leads, achieve higher lead qualification rates, and reduce the time that it takes to qualify a lead.

When you configure the predictive lead scoring feature, the application uses out-of-the-box fields related to leads to generate a model with a score. Using this score, users can do the following:
 
- Identify quality leads and convert them into opportunities.
 
- Spend time on leads that have low scores, and convert them into possible opportunities.

The predictive lead scoring lets you add custom fields to generate a model for predictive lead scoring that is accurate. The custom fields can be specific to your organization so that you can decide the impact of the outcome. 

The following illustration explains how you can configure the predictive lead scoring.

Before we configure the predictive lead scoring, let's understand the configuration page after a model is generated.

## Understand the configuration page

When a model is generated, the configuration page displays as shown in the following screenshot:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Configuration page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-configuration-page.png "Configuration page")

| Number | Feature | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
|1|Actions you can perform on the model|- **Publish**: The **Publish** button allows you to publish a model to your organization. Subsequently, users in your organization can see **My Open Leads Scored** system view and lead score widget on lead forms. After you publish, the **Publish** button is available only when you retrain or edit the model.<br>- **Revert version**: The **Revert version** button allows you to return the model to the previous version when the retrained model is not satisfactory or not at an acceptable level of your organization's requirements. This option is available only when you retrain a model.<br>- **Edit fields**: The **Edit fields** button allows you to update or add the fields that affect the prediction accuracy score. To learn more, see [Retrain the model](#retrain-a-model).<br>- **Retrain Model**: You can select this option to regenerate a model with updated information that is available in your organization for improved predictive accuracy score. This option is available only for standard model creation.|
|2|Version details|- **Version trained on**: This parameter displays a date that lets you know when the model was last trained.<br>- **Status**: This parameter lets you know the status of the model.<br>- **Attributes used**: This parameter lets you know the number of attributes (fields) used from the available list to generate the prediction accuracy score for the model. You can select the **Retrain with recommended fields** option to retrain the model with standard (out-of-the-box) attributes if the outcome of the trained model is not satisfactory.<br>- **Prediction accuracy**: This parameter displays the percentage of the model's accuracy in predicting the leads that could convert into opportunities.<br>- **Most influential fields**: This parameter displays the top five attributes (fields) that are most affecting the outcome of the prediction accuracy score. |
|3|Lead score grading| **Grading**: When a model is published, the leads that are in your organization's pipeline are graded according to the range defined in this section. Each lead in the pipeline is graded as A, B, C, or D according to the lead score that a lead has and this score is influenced by the attributes that we selected while creating the model. Leads that are graded as A are more likely to be converted into opportunities than leads that are graded D. You can configure the range for the grading according to your organizational requirements. When you change lead score range for a grade, the preceding grade's maximum range value changes automatically depending on the changed minimum grade value. For example, when you change the minimum range value score for **Grade A** to 51, the maximum lead score range for **Grade B** changes to 50. |

## Generate system-default model 

This model is generated based on the standard attributes (fields) that are chosen by the application.  

1. Verify that advanced Sales Insights features are enabled. To learn more, see [Enable and configure advanced Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#enable-and-configure-advanced-sales-insights-features). 

2. Go to **Change area** and select **Sales Insights settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Sales Insights settings option](media/si-admin-change-area-sales-insights-settings.png "Select Sales Insights settings option")

3. On the sitemap, select **Lead scoring** under **Predictive models**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, in the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Set up** from the **Predictive lead scoring** section to go to configuration page.

    The **Predictive lead scoring** configuration page is displayed.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predictive lead scoring getting started page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-getting-started-page.png "Predictive lead scoring getting started page")

4. Select **Get started**. The application starts generating a model, and a notification is displayed on the screen.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-training-notification.png "Model training notification")

5. After the model is generated, a confirmation notification displays with the prediction accuracy score and top five fields that are influencing the score. Select **Publish** or **View details**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training confirmation notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-confirmation-notification.png "Model training confirmation notification")

    - **Publish**: Select **Publish** if the score's accuracy is at an acceptable level as per your organization's standard.

    - **View details**: Select **View details** if the score's accuracy is not at an acceptable level. You can review the details of the model and edit the fields to improve the score's accuracy. To learn more, see [Retrain the model](#retrain-a-model). 

    To learn more about the configuration page, see [Understand the configuration page](#understand-the-configuration-page).

6. Publish the model. 

   The prediction lead scoring is applied in your organization. Users can see the lead scoring in their views under the **Lead Score** column and a widget in the lead form.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Adding the predictive lead scoring widget to a form through legacy form designer is not supported.

>[!NOTE]
>For more information on how predictive lead scoring helps users, see [Convert leads into opportunities](../sales/work-predictive-lead-scoring.md).

## Generate custom-defined model

At times, the system-defined model may not be accurate for your organization, as your organization might not use the standard attributes for leads that are used to generate the model. The enhanced predictive lead scoring chooses custom attributes that are specific to your organization to generate a model. Also, it allows you to choose custom attributes (fields) that are used to generate the lead score for a model.

Follow these steps:

1. Verify that advanced Sales Insights features are enabled. To learn more, see [Enable and configure advanced Sales Insights features](intro-admin-guide-sales-insights.md#enable-and-configure-advanced-sales-insights-features). 

2. Go to **Change area** and select **Sales Insights settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Sales Insights settings option](media/si-admin-change-area-sales-insights-settings.png "Select Sales Insights settings option")

3. On the sitemap, select **Lead scoring** under **Predictive models**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Alternatively, in the **Sales Insights settings** page, select **Set up** from the **Predictive lead scoring** section to go to configuration page.

    The **Predictive lead scoring** configuration page displays.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Predictive lead scoring getting started page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-getting-started-page.png "Predictive lead scoring getting started page")

4. Select **Get started**. 

    The application starts generating a model, and a notification is displayed on the screen. The application uses the standard attributes to generate the model.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-training-notification.png "Model training notification")

5. After the model is generated, a confirmation notification displays with the prediction accuracy score and top five fields that are influencing the score. Select **Publish** or **View details**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Model training confirmation notification](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-model-confirmation-notification.png "Model training confirmation notification")

    - **Publish**: Select **Publish** if the score's accuracy is at an acceptable level as per your organization's standard.

    - **View details**: Select **View details** if the score's accuracy is not at an acceptable level. You can review the details of the model and edit the fields to improve the score's accuracy. To learn more, see [Retrain the model](#retrain-a-model). 

6. On the **Edit model** page, select your custom attributes from **Main Entity** and **Related Entities**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Edit model page](media/si-admin-predictive-lead-scoring-edit-model-page.png "Edit model page")

7. Select **Retrain model**. 

    The model starts to generate with the selected custom attributes and a notification is displayed on the screen.

8. After the model is generated, publish the model.

    The prediction lead scoring is applied in your organization. Users can see the lead scoring in their views under the **Lead Score** column and a widget in the lead form.

## Retrain a model

When your model is old or the prediction accuracy score doesn't match your organization's standards, you can retrain the model, which in turn increases the prediction accuracy score. The application uses the latest data (leads) from your organization to train the model so that it can provide better accuracy of the lead score for your users. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you train the model once the data is refreshed in your organization for better prediction accuracy scoring.

1. Go to the predictive lead scoring configuration page, and select **Edit fields**.

2. Perform Steps 6 to 8 from [Generate custom-defined model](#generate-custom-defined-model).
